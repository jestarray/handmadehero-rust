# HandmadeHero-Rust
https://handmadehero.org/watch

HanmadeHero is a game made from scratch as possible*. I'm trying to port it to rust to make learning more interactive, engaging, and to have a 1:1 program comparison of rust vs c++.

## For future gamedev reference:

e18: 1:13:00 debunks why you shouldn't add previous frame time to compensate for missed frame

## todo:

* clean null types
* make subsystem = windows for winmain
* add skipped sound tutorial code
